The Modelica Vector graphics Editor (MoVE) is a cross platform graphical editor for
Modelica's **icon** annotation. MoVE opens the opportunity to create the graphical
representation of a model in a few minutes using a comfortable user interface.

== Unique features
MoVE contains some features that are unique and missing in similar projects:

- [x] generate pretty printed or one line annotation code
- [x] create **straight lines**, **circles** and **squares** by pressing the shift key
- [x] rotate the shapes
- [x] import existing models
- [x] include images by url or embed them as base64 encoded string
- [x] export your icons as **svg** or **png**
- [x] group and ungroup shapes

== Installation

IMPORTANT: If you are using http://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK]
install the https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX/Main[OpenJFX]
package first!

=== Using compiled releases
In order to install MoVE using our precompiled releases,
first check that you have a valid
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html[Java JRE version 8]
installed. After that
https://github.com/THM-MoTE/MoVE/releases/download/v0.7.0/Move-0.7.0.jar[grab the jar]
and run it by either double-clicking the jar or running the following
command in your terminal:
[source, sh]
  $ java -jar Move-0.7.0.jar &

=== Install from source
For installing from source follow this steps:

- install a http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java JDK version >= 1.8.0_77]
- install http://www.scala-sbt.org/[sbt]
- clone the repository `git clone https://git.thm.de/njss90/move.git`
- get into the directory and run  `sbt ";compile;run"`

==== Notes
If the javafx style manager says that he couldn't load a font (see example below) make sure the full project path
doesn't contain a space. (The font loader can't handle urls containing a space.)
_This error only occurs when running from sbt and doesn't effect assembled jar files._
