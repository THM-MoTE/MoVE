= Modelica Vector graphics Editor (MoVE)

The Modelica Vector graphics Editor (MoVE) is a cross platform graphical editor for
Modelica's **icon** annotation. MoVE opens the opportunity to create the graphical
representation of a model in a view minutes using a comfortable user interface.

== Unique features
MoVE contains some features that are unique and missing in similar projects:

- [x] generate pretty printed or one line annotation code
- [x] create **straight lines**, **circles** and **squares** by holding down the shift key
- [x] rotate the shapes
- [x] import existing models
- [x] import images and embed them either base64 encoded or
- [x] export your icons as **svg** or **png**
- [x] group and ungroup shapes
